# Running an IDE

## Section 1: Running Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
With Anaconda installed, two Python IDE – Jupyter Notebook and Spyder is automatically installed as well.
We strongly recommend beginners to start with using Jupyter Notebook.

### Note if you installed Python, you have to install Jupyter with the following steps
1. In the search bar, search for command prompt and open it.

2. Type "pip install notebook" and hit enter. (Alternatively, you may type pip install jupyterlab". jupyterlab is another flavour of jupyter notebook.)

3. Once it is completed. Type "juypter notebook" to run the notebook (or "jupyterlab" if you installed jupyterlab). A tab will automatically open in your browser. If not, type localhost:8888 into any browser.

### If you installed Anaconda, you can run Jupyter Notebook right away
To launch Jupyter Notebook, type “jupyter” in your PC’s search box and click on “Jupyter Notebook”

Jupyter offers two versions of user interface, i.e. JupyterLab and Jupyter notebook.

Personally, I highly recommend using JupyterLab. Steps to launch each version are as follow:

#### 1.1.1: Running JupyterLab
Open a browser and type in the link - [http://localhost:8888/lab](http://localhost:8888/lab)

#### 1.1.2: Running Jupyter notebook (classic version)
Open a browser and type in the link - [http://localhost:8888/tree](http://localhost:8888/tree)

### 1.2: Launch Spyder
To launch Spyder, type “spyder” in your PC’s search box and click on “Spyder”
